# [DANGER]
# What I'm doing in this test-spec is SUPER hacky, and I don't like this.
#
# - What I'm doing and why
#  - Invalidate require.cache to "observe required file on startup".
#  - Then restore require.cache to original state.
#
# - Just invalidating is not enough unless restoreing other spec file fail.
#
# - What happens just invalidate require.cache and NOT restored to original require.cache?
#  - For module such like `globlal-state.coffee` it instantiated at required time.
#  - Invalidating require.cache for `global-state.coffee` means, it's reloaded again.
#  - This 2nd reload return DIFFERENT globalState instance.
#  - So globalState is now no longer globally referencing same same object, it's broken.
#  - This situation is caused by explicit cache invalidation and not happen in real usage.
#
# - I know this spec is still super hacky and I want to find safer way.
#  - But I need this spec to detect unwanted file is required at startup( vmp get slower startup ).
